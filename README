How To Use
==========

External recipe sources are included in the project as git submodules.
These modules need to be initialized on first use:

# git submodule update --init

OpenEmbedded (BitBake) relies on the build environment providing a large
set of environment variables.  These are most easily set up by sourcing
the provide 'env' script:

# . ./env

And now you can build:

# bitbake <image>



How This Differs From Original
==============================

- Use oe-core instead of poky.  Poky is actually just oe-core plus
  two other kernel/bsp repos mashed together.  Since the Cargotec
  project doesn't use anything from these other repos, Poky brings
  nothing that oe-core doesn't already have.  Better to use oe-core
  as that's the open source project whereas Poky is Intel's monster...
